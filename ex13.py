from sys import argv

script, first, second, third = argv

print("the script is called:", script)
print("your first variable is:", first)
print("your second variable is:", second)
print("your third variable is:", third)

# e.g. python ex13.py a b c
# the one after python command is script and after it are arguments


# the difference between 'input' & 'argv' is that params needs to be entered is argv, params needs to be entered when you need it is input
